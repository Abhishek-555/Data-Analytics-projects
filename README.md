Principal component analysis (PCA) is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables (entities each of which takes on various numerical values) into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components.This model contains train and test data points of costumers in form of variable. The goal is to analyse which variable or customer is more likely to purchasse when they will visit the mall.
